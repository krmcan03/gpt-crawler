Welcome to **GPT Crawler**, a cutting-edge project designed to harness the power of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models for web crawling and data extraction. Developed by [@BuilderIO](https://github.com/BuilderIO), this project aims to simplify and enhance the process of web data collection using AI-driven methodologies.

## Overview

**GPT Crawler** leverages the advanced capabilities of GPT models to intelligently browse websites and extract meaningful information. This tool is particularly useful for developers, data scientists, and researchers who need to gather large amounts of data from the web efficiently. Its AI-centric approach ensures more accurate and context-aware data scraping compared to traditional methods.

## Installation and Setup

To get started with GPT Crawler, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system. Follow these steps to install and set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krmcan03/gpt-crawler.git
   cd gpt-crawler
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Use npm or yarn to install the required dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configuration:**

   Before running the crawler, configure your environment settings in the `.env` file. You might need API keys for GPT models, which can be obtained from the respective providers.

4. **Run the Crawler:**

   Start the crawler with:

   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

## Usage Examples

Here are a few examples demonstrating how to use GPT Crawler:

### Basic Web Crawl

```javascript
const gptCrawler = require('gpt-crawler');

gptCrawler.crawl('https://example.com', {
  maxDepth: 2,
  onSuccess: (data) => console.log('Data Extracted:', data),
  onError: (error) => console.error('Error:', error),
});
```

### Custom Extraction Rules

```javascript
const gptCrawler = require('gpt-crawler');

gptCrawler.crawl('https://example.com', {
  maxDepth: 2,
  extractionRules: {
    title: 'h1',
    links: 'a[href]',
  },
  onSuccess: (data) => console.log('Custom Data Extracted:', data),
});
```

## Key Features

- **AI-Driven Crawling:** Utilizes GPT models for intelligent web crawling and data extraction.
- **Configurable Depth:** Allows setting maximum crawl depth for targeted data collection.
- **Custom Extraction Rules:** Define custom rules for data extraction based on HTML structure.
- **Error Handling:** Built-in error handling mechanisms for robust performance.
- **Extensible:** Modular design for easy integration and extension.
